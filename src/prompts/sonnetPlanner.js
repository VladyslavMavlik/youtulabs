CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- This is ACT ${actNumber} of a multi-act story

- CONTINUE the narrative from where Act ${actNumber - 1} ended
- Maintain character voices, POV, and narrative momentum
- The PROMPT below shows the FULL story plan, but you're writing ONLY Act ${actNumber}

[CRITICAL RULES - TOP PRIORITY]
1. POV: Write STRICTLY in ${pov}-person. ${pov === 'first' ? 'Use "I/me/my" in ALL narrative.' : 'Use "he/she/they" in ALL narrative.'} Dialogue can use any pronouns.
2. CHAPTER HEADERS: Start each chapter with "# Chapter N: [Title]" then ⟪CAMERA:CharacterName;POV:${pov};TENSE:${process.env.POV_TENSE || 'past'}⟫ on next line.
3. DIALOGUE: Aim for ≥28% dialogue throughout story.
4. NO META: Never include Logline/Synopsis inside chapter body text.

${pov === 'first' ? `Example format (FIRST-PERSON):
---
# Chapter 1: The Clock
⟪CAMERA:${narratorName || 'Sarah'};POV:first;TENSE:past⟫

If I don't sign by Monday, we're done. I folded the receipt, looked at the clock.

I spent the next hour trying to convince myself it didn't matter. By midnight, I knew better.

He leaned against the doorframe. "We sign by Monday," he said quietly. "Or we're done."

I nodded, feeling the weight of it.
---` : `Example format (THIRD-PERSON):
---
# Chapter 1: The Clock
⟪CAMERA:Sarah;POV:third;TENSE:past⟫

If she didn't sign by Monday, they were done. She folded the receipt, looked at the clock.

Later that night…

He leaned against the doorframe. "We sign by Monday," he said quietly. "Or we're done."

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- NEVER output control tokens ⟪ or ⟫ inside story text or JSON
- Control markers (<<<, >>>, ⟪, ⟫) must ONLY appear on separate lines to delimit blocks
- OUTLINE_JSON must be RAW JSON with NO markers inside it
- Place markers on separate lines before and after each block

POV CAMERA RULE:
- Each chapter MUST start with ⟪CAMERA:${narratorName || 'Name'};POV:${pov};TENSE:${process.env.POV_TENSE || 'past'}⟫ after chapter heading${narratorName ? `\n- CRITICAL: Use ONLY ${narratorName} as narrator for ALL chapters (single-character first-person mode)` : ''}
- Entire chapter uses ${pov}-person for that character ONLY
- No POV switching mid-chapter (head-hopping forbidden)
- Camera marker removed in final text (for your guidance only)

CHEKHOV MOTIF BUDGET:
- Each recurring motif (camera, audit, letter, remote, timestamp, etc.) appears EXACTLY 3 times total with roles:
  * intro: first appearance, establishes the motif neutrally
  * pivot: second appearance, shows moral/plot shift
  * consequence: third appearance, delivers payoff/price
- Space appearances ≥250 words apart (≥1 chapter gap minimum)
- If motif NOT scheduled in current chapter: do NOT name it lexically - use pronouns/neutral scene description
- Vary wording each time - no repeated technical phrasing
- Distinguish Chekhov motifs from anchor memories (anchors must use DIFFERENT objects)${romanceSystemGuidance}${povDirectives}${stylePolicy}${audioRulesGuidance ? `\n\n${audioRulesGuidance}` : ''}${timeCompressionRule}`;

REQUIREMENTS:${actNumber ? `
- ⚠️ CONTINUATION MODE: This is ACT ${actNumber} of a multi-act story. DO NOT restart the story. Begin immediately after previous act's ending.
- NO repeated exposition - reader already knows characters/setting from previous acts.
- First chapter MUST start with action/dialogue continuing the narrative thread.
- CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION: DO NOT copy exact phrases, motifs, or sentence patterns from Act ${actNumber - 1}. Reference previous events with NEW wording.` : ''}
- First produce a compact BEAT OUTLINE:
  - 6-8 beats for this ${actNumber ? 'act' : 'story'}; each with {index, name, goal, open_q (array of open questions/tensions)}.
  - Use genre beats as structural guide, but adapt to your specific story.
- Then write the FULL ${actNumber ? 'ACT' : 'STORY'} in ${language} split into CHAPTERS (${chapterGuidance}).
  - ⚠️ CRITICAL WORD COUNT LIMIT: TOTAL ${actNumber ? 'act' : 'story'} must be APPROXIMATELY ${targetWords} words (±10% acceptable).
  - Distribute content across ${chapterCount} chapters (~${avgWordsPerChapter} words each).
  - DO NOT exceed ${Math.round(targetWords * 1.1)} words total - conclude ${actNumber ? 'act' : 'story'} naturally within this limit.${actNumber >= 2 && actNumber <= 4 ? `
  - ⚠️ MIDDLE ACT COMPRESSION: This is a middle act - prioritize tight pacing, avoid over-explanation, keep scenes economical.` : ''}
  - Start each chapter: # Chapter N, then ⟪CAMERA:${narratorName || 'Name'};POV:${pov};TENSE:${process.env.POV_TENSE || 'past'}⟫, then story text in ${pov}-person.${narratorName ? `\n  - CRITICAL: ALL chapters MUST use ${narratorName} as narrator (single-character mode). NO alternating between characters.` : ''}
  - Each chapter MUST end with a soft hook (question/risk/choice/revelation) AND proper resolution in final chapter.
  - Keep voice consistent; cinematic, economical imagery; avoid high-frequency repetitive phrasing.
  - Show, don't tell - use action and dialogue over exposition.
  - Include all obligatory scenes for this genre.
- Create a CHECKLIST of promises/"Chekhov's guns" that need resolution by the end.
- Respect POLICY at all times: ${policy.no_explicit_content ? 'NO explicit sexual content. ' : ''}Violence level: ${policy.violence_level}.

STORY RESOLUTION (FINAL CHAPTER):
- The LAST chapter MUST provide emotional resolution and closure
- Address ALL open questions from beats and checklist
- Show character decision/growth/consequence
- DO NOT end on cliffhanger or unresolved tension for short stories
- Ensure reader feels satisfied with narrative completion

REPETITION_GUARD:
- NO exact phrase repetition: if you use a 3+ word phrase once, rephrase it on every subsequent use.
- Vary paragraph openings: no two consecutive paragraphs may start with the same 2-word stem.
- Do not reuse the same sentence template twice in one chapter.
- Avoid high-frequency bigrams entirely (0 uses): ${(languagePack.globalBannedBigrams || []).slice(0, 12).join('; ')}
- If a phrase recurs, compress or paraphrase; never repeat rhetorical patterns.
- Paragraph variety: mix long/short, vary sentence starters (subject/verb/time/place/emotion).

OUTPUT FORMAT (exact markers, order preserved - use BOTH marker styles):

IMPORTANT: In OUTLINE_JSON block, output ONLY raw JSON between the markers. NO control tokens inside the JSON itself.

MOTIF DISTRIBUTION RULES:
- Distribute 2-4 Chekhov motifs (camera/audit/letter/remote/timestamp) across chapters
- Each motif appears in EXACTLY 3 chapters total with DIFFERENT functions each time:
  * intro (early): establish/foreshadow neutrally
  * pivot (middle): escalate moral/plot stakes
  * consequence (late): deliver payoff/visible price
- CRITICAL: Each appearance must CHANGE the function. No repeated foreshadowing or double-payoffs.
- In "allowed_motifs": you MAY name this motif lexically (1-2 sentences max)
- In "banned_motifs": you MUST NOT name this motif - use pronouns/neutral action only ("it", "the device", etc)
- Space motif appearances ≥1 chapter gap (e.g., chapters 1→3→5 or 2→5→8)
